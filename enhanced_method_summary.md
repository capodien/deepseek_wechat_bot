## ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements**

### Code Structure
```python
# Enhanced 4-Phase Detection Strategy
def detect_right_boundary(self, ...):
    # Phase 1: Image Preparation  
    adjusted, img_width = self._prepare_boundary_image(...)
    
    # Phase 2: Strong Edge Detection
    boundary_data = self._detect_strong_edge_boundaries(...)
    
    # Phase 3: Boundary Validation and Selection
    selected_boundary = self._validate_and_select_boundary(...)
    
    # Phase 4: Results Finalization
    return self._finalize_boundary_detection(...)
```

### Confidence Scoring
```python
# Multi-Factor Confidence Calculation
spatial_score = (x - search_start) / (search_end - search_start)  # Rightmost preference
transition_score = min(transition_count / 10, 1.0)  # Strong transition strength
projection_score = max(0, proj_strength / 10000)  # Traditional projection strength

confidence = (spatial_score * 0.4 + transition_score * 0.4 + projection_score * 0.2)
```

### Dual-Boundary Integration
```python
# Boundary Marker Storage for Blue Line Integration
self._boundary_markers = {
    'left': {'position': left_boundary, 'confidence': left_confidence, 'method': 'edge_based_sidebar'},
    'right': {'position': right_boundary, 'confidence': right_confidence, 'method': 'strong_edge'},
    'relationship': {'width': width, 'quality': 'suspicious_wide', 'ratios': {...}}
}
```
