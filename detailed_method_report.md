# Strong Edge Transition Detection Method - Detailed Report

## Overview

Based on your key observation: **"look at the right boundary, the horizontal pixel differences is high right on the edge. Can you use this feature to detect the boundary?"**

This method successfully uses strong horizontal pixel differences to accurately detect the right boundary of WeChat message cards.

## Method Details: Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Image Preprocessing
**Tool**: OpenCV level adjustment with gamma correction
```python
# Photoshop-style levels adjustment
arr = np.clip((gray - INPUT_BLACK_POINT) / (INPUT_WHITE_POINT - INPUT_BLACK_POINT), 0, 1)
arr = (arr ** (1/GAMMA)) * 255
```

**Parameters**:
- `INPUT_BLACK_POINT = 32`
- `INPUT_WHITE_POINT = 107` 
- `GAMMA = 0.67`

**Result**: High-contrast image with white message cards on black background

### Phase 2: Strong Edge Transition Detection
**Tool**: NumPy horizontal difference calculation
```python
# Compute horizontal pixel differences
diff_x = np.diff(adjusted.astype(np.int16), axis=1)

# Detect strong white-to-black transitions
strong_transition_threshold = -100  # Based on your observation
strong_negative_mask = diff_x < strong_transition_threshold
```

**Key Innovation**: Focus on strong transitions (< -100) that indicate sharp card edges

### Phase 3: Vertical Projection Analysis
**Tool**: NumPy summation and column analysis
```python
# Count strong transitions per column
strong_edge_projection = np.sum(strong_negative_mask, axis=0)

# Find columns with significant transitions
min_strong_transitions = 2
for x in range(len(strong_edge_projection)):
    if strong_edge_projection[x] >= min_strong_transitions:
        strong_columns.append((x, strong_edge_projection[x]))
```

**Logic**: Columns with multiple strong transitions indicate boundary regions

### Phase 4: Boundary Candidate Selection
**Tool**: Custom scoring algorithm
```python
# Combine strong transition count + traditional projection strength
combined_score = transition_count * 1000 + projection_strength

# Priority: Rightmost boundary with sufficient transitions
boundary_candidates.sort(key=lambda b: b[0], reverse=True)
```

**Selection Criteria**:
1. **Primary**: Rightmost position (closest to actual boundary)
2. **Minimum**: 2+ strong transitions per column
3. **Fallback**: Traditional peak detection if no strong transitions
